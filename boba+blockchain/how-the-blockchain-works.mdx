# Key Concepts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hash">
    ## Hash
    A hash is a fingerprint of some digital data.

    Regardless if the input data is 1 char or an entire library, a unique hash will be generated. SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) produces a fixed-size 256-bit hash value.
    ```math
    2^{256} = 1.1579209 \times 10^{77} \space \text{combinations}
    ```

    According to [Bitbo](https://bitbo.io/how-many-users), there is reportedly 200 million active Bitcoin addresses.

    The chances you randomly guess/brute force a seed phrase is about:
    ```math
    1/8.6 \times 10^{-78}
    ```

    > TLDR: The odds someone hacks your Bitcoin address through guessing/brute force is essentially 0.

  <Step title="Block">
    ## Block
    A block is a container that holds a list of transactions or data records.

    ### Components
    - **Data**: Transactions or records that the block stores
    - **Nonce**: A value used in mining to find a valid hash
    - **Hash**: Digital signature combining block number, data, previous block's hash, nonce, and timestamp

  </Step>

  <Step title="Blockchain">
    ## Blockchain
    A chain of blocks that are cryptographically linked together.

    Blockchains are "immutable" because changing ANY data in a block will:
    - Change the hash of that block
    - Invalidate all subsequent blocks
    - Each block can hold ~4,000 transactions (1MB limit)

  <Step title="Distributed System">
    ## Distributed System
    The network is distributed, meaning:
    - Anyone can see the blockchain
    - The network accepts the majority consensus
    - The longest chain is typically considered valid
