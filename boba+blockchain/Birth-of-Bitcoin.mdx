On October 31, 2008, an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" on a cryptography mailing list called the Metzdowd Cryptography Mailing List.

  href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
/>

This whitepaper includes 12 sections, but we will focus on the 5 most fundamental aspects that form the foundation of Bitcoin:

1. Electronic Cash System - How Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries
2. Transactions - The building blocks of Bitcoin using digital signatures
3. Timestamp Server & Proof-of-Work - How consensus is achieved and secured
4. Network Architecture - How the network operates and verifies transactions
5. Incentives & Mining - The economic model that keeps the network running

<Steps>
  <Step title="Electronic Cash System">
    Current financial markets rely on financial middlemen - when transacting online with strangers, you must rely on third parties like banks.

    A peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

    Bitcoin focuses on building trustless systems built on top of computer science versus traditional trust-based systems.

  <Step title="Transactions">
    Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Bitcoin network, utilizing digital signatures for security.

    Each transaction relies on two key components:
    - Public keys: Function like an email address for receiving bitcoin and viewing balances
    - Private keys: Act as a password to control funds and sign transactions

    Digital signatures ensure:
    - Only the rightful owner can spend their bitcoin
    - Transactions cannot be forged or tampered with
    - All transactions are [publicly verifiable](https://btcscan.org/)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Timestamp Server & Proof-of-Work">
    The Bitcoin network uses Proof of Work and timestamp servers to validate transactions and achieve consensus:

    Timestamp Server:
    - Creates an immutable chronological order of transactions
    - Each block contains a timestamp and link to previous block
    - Forms an unbroken chain of transaction history

    Proof of Work:
    - Requires significant computational effort to create blocks
    - One CPU equals one vote in the network
    - The longest chain represents the network consensus
    - Makes the system computationally expensive to attack

  </Step>

  <Step title="Network Architecture">
    The Bitcoin network operates on a distributed peer-to-peer model:

    Key Components:
    - Nodes maintain and verify the complete transaction history
    - New transactions are broadcast to all nodes
    - Each node collects transactions into blocks
    - Nodes accept only valid blocks and transactions
    - Nodes express acceptance by working on the next block

    Network Rules:
    - All nodes operate under the same protocol
    - Invalid transactions are rejected automatically
    - The longest valid chain is always accepted as truth

  </Step>

  <Step title="Incentives & Mining">
    The network is secured through economic incentives:

    Mining Process:
    - Miners validate transactions and create new blocks
    - Complex mathematical problems must be solved
    - Successful miners receive newly created bitcoins
    - Block rewards incentivize honest participation

    Economic Model:
    - Mining requires significant investment in hardware
    - Energy costs create natural economic barriers
    - Miners are incentivized to protect network value
    - Attack costs exceed potential profit
