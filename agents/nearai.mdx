## How NEAR AI Enables the Next Generation of AI Agents

NEAR AI is changing how AI operates by shifting control from corporations to users. Instead of relying on centralized servers, AI Agents built with NEAR AI can function independently while ensuring transparency and security.

With NEAR AI, AI Agents can:

- **Give users full control over their data** – No third parties dictate how information is stored or used.
- **Operate without centralized oversight** – Agents adapt, learn, and make decisions in real-time.
- **Connect with decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts** – Expanding their capabilities in open ecosystems.
- **Support a builder-first economy** – Developers can earn rewards for contributing to AI advancements.

NEAR AI isn’t just another AI platform—it’s a foundation for building AI that serves people, not corporations.
By combining open-source principles with decentralized infrastructure, it ensures AI remains accessible, accountable, and built for the future.

## What Comes Next?

Now that we’ve explored what AI Agents are and how they operate, the next step is understanding the core intelligence behind them: Large Language Models (LLMs).

LLMs enable AI Agents to reason, learn from interactions, and generate dynamic responses, making them far more than just rule-based systems. But how do LLMs work? And more importantly, how does NEAR AI integrate them to create scalable, decentralized AI Agents?

A deeper understanding of LLMs is essential for building more capable AI Agents. In the next guide, we’ll examine their inner workings and their role in shaping the next generation of autonomous systems.
