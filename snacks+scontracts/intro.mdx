title: Intro to Smart Contracts
description: "Self executing code stored on the blockchain network"
---

This workshop will focus on smart contracts with an emphasis on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We will cover at a high level what a smart contract is,
and how they can be used to create decentralized applications (dApps), more specifically on the Ethereum network.

> A disclaimer I want to make at the start of this workshop is that I want you guys to treat blockchains and web3
> just as any other software. I want to take it from first principles and an objective standpoint. At the end of the day,
> software is neutral, it's how you use it that makes it "good" or "bad".
