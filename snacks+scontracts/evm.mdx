### What is a Virtual Machine?

To understand [what a virtual machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine), let's briefly talk about physical machines. Physical machines can simply be understood
as the hardware that runs on your computer.

Imagine EVM as a computer that specializes in handling smart contract transactions as well as defining
the rules for state changes from block to block in the Ethereum blockchain. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or
"virtual" version of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer—such
as your personal computer— and/or a remote server.

However, unlike physical computers, these computers exist in a software environment, not hardware. Virtual machines are software that simulates real computers.

The EVM is a virtual machine that is not bound to a single operating system or location, thus allowing global accessibility for anyone willing to run an Ethereum node.
Virtual machines are also platform agnostic, allowing compatibility to a wide range of systems, irrespective of the underlying hardware.
