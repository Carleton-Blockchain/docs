title: Intro to Foundry + Solidity
description: "What is Foundry and Solidity anyways?"
---

Solidity a high level programming language that is used to create smart contracts, mainly for Ethereum.
It resembles Java and Javascript.

Start by changing into the directory we want to create our foundry project

```
forge init --template https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template sc_demo
cd sc_demo
```

Below is a general overview of what the project contains:

    Foundry[Foundry Project] --> src[src/]
    Foundry --> test[test/]

    Foundry --> lib[lib/]
    Foundry --> foundrytoml[foundry.toml]

    src --> contracts[Smart Contracts .sol]
    test --> testfiles[Test Files _test.sol]
    script --> deployments[Deployment Scripts]
    lib --> dependencies[Dependencies]

    subgraph Key Components
        src[src/ - Source Contracts]
        test[test/ - Test Files]
        script[script/ - Deployment Scripts]
        lib[lib/ - External Libraries]
        foundrytoml[foundry.toml - Config File]
    end

    style Foundry fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style Key Components fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#333
```

Let's navigate to `src/Counter.sol`
You will find a starter template.

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

Now to interact with this project, we will need to first deploy the contract first.

However, theres a few steps we need to undertake before we can actually deploy the contract.
