</Step>

  <Step title="Connect wallet to testnet">
    For the purposes of our demo, we are going to complete all operations on _Testnet_. 
    Mainnet is real. You are transacting with real currencies etc. On Testnet is a sandbox environment 
    and duplicate of Mainnet. As the name suggests, it provides developers with a sandbox environment to
    test code.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fund Wallet">
    Since it's a testnet, funds are free. However, since we are simulating a real
    environment, actions on-chain will still require gas. That is why we need to
    fund in. Take your Sepolia public address and put it into [Google Web3
    Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)

<Step title="Create env file in Foundry project">
  It's good practice to keep sensitive info such as private keys hidden in env
  files.

```markdown {1}
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Wallet Private Key">
  Your private keys are used to sign transactions on the blockchain. When we are
  deploying a contract on-chain, we are the ones signing off on this action.
</Step>

<Step title="RPC Node">
  RPC nodes act as the bridge between your code and the actual blockchain. We
  can get a free one right [here](https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com).

```markdown {2}
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
```

Now lets run source .env to update your load your env file into your project

```markdown
source .env
```

</Step>
